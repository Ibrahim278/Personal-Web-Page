      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from University of Lahore in Islamabad Pakistan.
        Throughout my degree, I studied core courses such as Computer Programming, Calculus, Compiler Construction,
        Software Engineering, Object Oriented Programming, HCI, Networking, Database Systems and AI.
         </p>
      <p> After completing 3rd year, I enrolled several academy courses to strenghthen my creative skills in programming
          & design. I learned several concepts in C++, Java, and Graphic Design as well as Android Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I began final year, I started my final year project in SMS Spam Detection using Android Studio & Machine Learning.
        In this project, I collected raw data in the form of text and compiled that data in Python. Once my work in Python was
        finished, I created an app in Android Studio. And in the final stage, I wrote an 80 page thesis on the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the final stages of my degree, I completed a 1 month internship in Graphic Design and as I graduated, with these
        technical skills I got my first job as a graphic designer in a Digital Marketing Agency where I worked for 2 years before
        coming to Vancouver, BC, Canada to pursue further studies. My long term goals include strengthing my programming skills
        and specializing in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
